## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- Push notification for the active tasks.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- MVC architecture
- ES6 Modules
- ES6 Classes

### Dependencies

- core-js
- regenerator-runtime
- transformer-sass
- parcel

### Running locally

From the repo:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it via command `git clone <URL of your forked repo>`
- cd `<forked repo directory>`
- Type `npm i` in your bash/command line
- Type `npm run build` in your bash/command line for production
- Type `npm start` to start your local development server

### What I learned

Now, I'm more confident in **MVC architecture**. Combining ES6 modules & ES6 classes to make a modular, scalable, & flexible app. Abstracted each function into a module. Further, I want to co-relate MVC architecture with React library.

### Continued development

Implementing this architecture using some frameworks/libraries such as ReactJS to optimize the app more & handle a large code base; coupled with both frontend & backend.
