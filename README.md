## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- Push notification for the active tasks.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- MVC architecture
- ES6 Modules
- ES6 Classes 

### What I learned

Now, I'm more confident in **MVC architecture**. Combining ES6 modules & ES6 classes together to make modular, scalable, & flexible app. Abstracted each function into a module. Further I want to correlate mvc architecture with React library.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  
}
```

### Continued development

Implementing this architecture using some frameworks/library such as ReactJS to optimise the app more & handle a large code base; coupled with both frontend & backend.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
